# Notes

``#include <stdio.h>`` let's one work with input and output

The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore, it is often safer to use double for most calculations - but note that it takes up twice as much memory as float (8 bytes vs. 4 bytes).
